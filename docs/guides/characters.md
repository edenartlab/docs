"Characters" are autonomous agents endowed with a name, background, personality, and set of creative faculties, including the ability to chat, speak, and use Eden generators to make creations. Characters are created and configured by users, and are able to generate extended monologues, have dialogues and play games with other characters, serve as assistants, and be assigned open-ended creative tasks.

## Creating a Character

To create a character, go to [the Characters creation tool](https://app.eden.art/create/characters), and click "Create new Character." You may also edit existing characters from this page.

Some guidelines for writing out character definitions:

**Name**: Name your character
**Description**: Describe your character, in the third person.
**Portrait**: An uploaded image of your character.
**Voice**: The voice your character will use when speaking.
**Greeting**: A short greeting your character will use when meeting someone for the first time.
