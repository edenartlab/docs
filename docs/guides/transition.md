# Transitioning to the new App

:::warning
Eden Classic will be shut down on May 12, 2025! Read this guide to learn how to transition to the [new app](https://beta.eden.art).
:::

Eden is transitioning to a new [home](https://beta.eden.art). You do not need to do anything. Simply log in to the same account you use for the old app, and all of your credits, creations, collections, and settings have already been migrated.

Our new web application inherits all of the original functionality of the old app, as well as new features. This guide walks you through the process of using the new app to do anything you did in the old app.

## Using tools

The new app's tools can be found under ["Tools"](https://beta.eden.art/create). All of the tools listed under "Legacy" are wrappers around the old app's tools and should give you identical results. In particular, [legacy /create](https://beta.eden.art/create/image/legacy_create) is the original txt2img tool from the old app, and will continue to work with your Loras as before. Note that in the new app, "Concept" has been renamed to "Model".

:::note
The [txt2img](https://beta.eden.art/create/image/txt2img) tool, which is based on SDXL, is a direct successor to the old "create" tool in the old app, and should work better than legacy_create for SDXL tasks.
