# Mission

With the rise of generative models that produce realistic text, images, video, and sound, a new artform and industry has formed atop a relatively small cache of open-source models, datasets, code, and compute resources. Many tools, services, and APIs have emerged to support users of these resources and meet the needs of this ecosystem.

Despite the prevalence of open-source models and tooling, much effort is duplicated reinventing solutions to common problems such as data acquisition, training, customizing, deployment, and serving models in a reliable and efficient way. Most of these services are closed or proprietary, creating platform risk for users and application developers, and limiting innovation from users who are unable to access or modify the underlying code or data.

Eden improves this by fostering a commons for the generative AI space.

Our core principles are:

- **Open source and open access**. We believe in the power of open source software to foster innovation, collaboration, and democratization in AI.
- **Creator-centric**. We believe that creators should in charge and in control of their own data and artistic outputs.
- **Interoperable and composable**. We strive to make our tools maximally expandable, adaptable, and interoperable with other platforms and tools.

Problems we are trying to solve:

* **Curation and discovery**: in the age of infinite content, how can we help users create or find what they are looking for?
* **Cold-start problem**: how can new artistic projects get off the ground without a large corpus of data or a large audience?
* **Generative AI platform risk**: how can we ensure that users are not locked into a single platform or service?
