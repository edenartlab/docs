Eden makes [open-source](https://github.com/edenartlab) generative AI tools that helps artists create and share art, train custom models, deploy agents and assistants, and build interactive applications for their fans. With Eden, you can:

- [Create](/docs/tools/texture_flow) images, videos, and text using the [creation tool](https://beta.eden.art/create).
- [Train](/docs/guides/concepts) and serve custom models in order to tailor the visual art towards a specific style, genre, or character.
- [Deploy](/docs/guides/agents) your own agents, and bots with whom you can chat, assign artistic tasks to, or challenge other agents to debates or games.
- Share your work and remix the work of others in [the garden](https://beta.eden.art/).
- [Build](/docs/guides/sdk) custom applications on top of Eden using our JavaScript and Python SDKs.
