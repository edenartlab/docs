Eden makes [open-source](https://github.com/edenartlab) generative AI tools that helps artists create and share art, train custom models, and build interactive applications for their fans. With Eden, you can:

- [Create](/docs/guides/creation) images, videos, and text using the [creation tool](https://app.eden.art/create/creations).
- [Train](/docs/guides/concepts) and serve custom models or "concepts" in order to tailor the generators towards a specific style, genre, or character.
- Share your work and remix the work of others in [the garden](https://app.eden.art).
- [Deploy](/docs/guides/characters) your own characters, agents, and bots with whom you can chat, assign artistic tasks to, or challenge other characters to debates or games.
- [Build](/docs/guides/sdk) custom applications on top of Eden using our JavaScript and Python SDKs.

### Mission & Team

Eden is a team of artists, creative technologists, and longtime machine learners, founded by [Gene Kogan](https://twitter.com/genekogan) and [Xander Steenbrugge](https://twitter.com/xsteenbrugge), two OGs in the AI art space. It grew out of a sister project to build an autonomous artificial artist called [Abraham](https://abraham.ai).

Our core principles are:

- **Open source and open access**. We believe in the power of [open source](https://github.com/edenartlab) software to foster innovation, collaboration, and democratization in AI.
- **Creator-centric**. We believe that creators and professional artists should in charge and in control of their own data and likeness online.
- **Interoperable and composable**. We strive to make our tools maximally expandable, adaptable, and interoperable with other platforms and tools, with numerous ways for creators and developers to plug in and contribute.

Problems we are actively trying to solve:

* **Curation and discovery**: in the age of infinite content, how can we help users create or find what they are looking for? How can we make recommendation algorithms that support user intentions and preferences, instead of just maximizing engagement?
* **Cold-start problem**: how can new artistic projects get traction without a large pre-existing audience?
