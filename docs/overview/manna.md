# Manna

Manna is the internal currency of Eden. Creators must spend Manna to make creations on Eden.

The [creation tool](https://beta.eden.art/create) is roughly priced according to the following:

* Each image produced by an image generating endpoint costs 1 manna.
* Videos cost between 0.5-0.75 manna per frame.
* [Training concepts](/docs/guides/concepts.md) costs 75 manna.

## How to get manna

New users receive free manna upon sign-up.

To top up, manna may be [purchased](https://beta.eden.art/settings/subscription) ad-hoc.

The Eden team actively gives out free manna to community members who contribute to Eden in some way, through various giveaways and community events. To learn more or propose collaborations, get in touch with us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/4dSYwDT) or come to the next Miracle.

## Manna subscriptions

Users are encouraged to [sign up for a subscription plan](https://beta.eden.art/settings/subscription), which gives them access to various premium features and a regular replenishment of manna each month.

In the beginning of each month, remaining subscription manna expire and are restored to the top of the subscription plan's full amount. For example, Pro subscribers reset to 5000 manna. Manna which is purchased ad-hoc or "topped up" does not ever expire. When you spend Manna, you always spend your subscription Manna first (if you have a subscription), and only begin to spend your non-expiring Manna once your subscription Manna is depleted.
