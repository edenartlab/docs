# Manna

Manna is the internal currency of Eden. Creators must expend Manna to take actions on Eden, including to [make creations](/docs/guides/creation).

The [creation tool](https://app.eden.art/create/creations) is roughly priced according to the following:

* Each image produced by an image generating endpoint (currently /create, /blend, and /remix) costs 1 manna.
* Videos produced by /interpolate and /real2real costs between 0.5-0.75 manna per frame.
* [Training concepts](/docs/guides/concepts.md) costs 75 manna.

## How to get manna

New users receive free manna upon sign-up.

To top up, manna may be [purchased](https://app.eden.art/manna).

The Eden team actively gives out free manna to community members who contribute to Eden in some way, through various giveaways and community events. To learn more or propose collaborations, get in touch with us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/4dSYwDT).
