# Manna

Manna is the internal currency of Eden. Creators must expend Manna to take actions on Eden, including to [make creations](/docs/guides/creation).

The [creation tool](https://app.eden.art/create) is priced according to the following:
* Each image produced by /create and /remix costs 1 manna.
* Each vieeo produced by /interpolate and /real2real costs 1 manna per frame.

## How to get manna

New users receive 500 free manna upon sign-up.

To top up, manna may be purchased as well.

The Eden team actively gives out free manna to community members who actively contribute to Eden in some way. To learn more or propose collaborations, get in touch with us [on Discord](https://discord.gg/4dSYwDT).
